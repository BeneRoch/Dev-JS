Dev-JS
======

This Github contains most of the new plugins I created. Please note that in a near future, I'll create new repo for each plugins that is worth it, with detailed examples and demo pages. Most of these plugin are documented in the .js file itself until I get my things up and create a website to hold detailed explanations.

Enjoy
